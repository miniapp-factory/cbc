A stylized logo for a 2048 mini app, featuring a 4x4 grid of square tiles with rounded corners. The tiles are arranged in a clean, modern design with a subtle gradient background. Each tile displays a number (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048) in a bold, sans-serif font. The central tile is highlighted with a brighter color to emphasize the goal of reaching 2048. The overall color palette is a mix of dark blue and teal, with white text for contrast. The logo is centered on a light gray background, giving it a polished, professional look suitable for a web app icon.
